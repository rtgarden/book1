    theres a
    song in my 
    heart for the
    one I love     
    best and her
    picture is 
    tatooed all
    over my 
    chest yea-
    ho little fish
    dont cry 
    dont cry
    yea ho 
    little fish
    dont cry 
    dont cry
    There are fish
    in the sea
    theres no doubt about it
    just as good
    as the ones
    that have come
    out of it
    The crew are asleep
    and the oceans at rest
    and im singing tis song
    to the one
    I love best
