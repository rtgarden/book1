The smert city concept which does not adress this is complicit in making the sensor network system only

the mirror neuron system and its recent elucidation

the historical roots of the mechanical man or manservant/womanservant robot.

modeling the nursemaid vs modeling the baby

how the assumption and presence of the fantasy of the robot interferes.

they end up modeling the sensor network of the fantsy servant and not understanding the problem that needs to be solved and the sensor networks ability to adapt to that problem. tailoring the sensor network and its feedback system.
you want to know whos mirror neuron system you are extending.
