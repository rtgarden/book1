   
     Thanks for grabbing my music player script.  I wrote this script primarily because I wasn't happy with most of the other music scripts out there, no offense.  This script is a preloading script and has worked much better than most of the other music scripts i have tested against it.  Please be aware that this script pauses for 10 seconds before playing, it's a necessary evil though as this makes the song skip much less.  Let me know what you think! :)

    There are 6 variables that need to be set up in the script :

--firstsongname and secondsongname--
These variables refer to filenames, firstsong name is the text that comes before the file number and secondsongname is what comes after it.
For example:
In the filename Gorillaz001.wav, firstsongname is "Gorillaz" and secondsongname is ".wav"

--curfile--
This tells the script what filenumber to start on.  Most don't need to change this.

--digits:--
This tells the script how many digits are in the filenumbers.
For Example:
In the filename Gorillaz001.wav there are 3 digits for the filenumber

--totalfiles--
The total number of files, pretty self-explanitory

--volume--
The volume to play at, also self-explanitory :)
