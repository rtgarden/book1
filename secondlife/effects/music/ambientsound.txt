// Ambient Sound script by Alfkin Small.

// To use: Place this script in the object that you want to play a sound.
// The object need not be special.  Just place is where you want the sound
// to come from.
// Drop a sound file in the object, then change the key sound line below to
// the name of your sound file.
// If you like, you can set the min and max values as well, in addition to
// the volume.  That's all there is to it!

// Set debug to TRUE if you'd like to get debugging messages, otherwise
// leave the next line alone.

// Minimum amount of time (in seconds) between sounds.

// This is the volume at which the sound will play.  0 = Inaudible
// Valid values are between 0.0 - 1.0
